# SceneBridge

A simple additive scene loading system with a built-in loading screen workflow.

Loads scenes asynchronously in the background, keeps them inactive until fully ready, displays a loading canvas during the transition with an accurate loading bar, and then cleanly activates the new scene while unloading the old one, with a garbage collection pass in between. Designed to provide smooth, controlled scene transitions with minimal setup.

## Features 
- A singleton-based Scene Loader

	- Easy `SceneBridge Loader` prefab provided to drag and drop into your project 
- Custom loading screens 
	- Loading screen can display the current progress of the `AsyncOperation`
	- Loading screen can display various backgrounds with a random selection from an array in the `SceneBridge Loader` prefab
 		- (Optional) Text and image color synchronization accross background images
			- `LoadingScreen.correlateTipColorWithBackgoundImg`
			- `LoadingScreen.correlateHeaderColorWithBackgoundImg`
			- `LoadingScreen.correlateloadingBarColorWithBackgoundImg`

			- `InputManagerGatedLoadingScreen.correlateProgColorWithBackgoundImg`
	- Loading screen can display various text snippets (for tips, lore tidbits, etc.) with a random selection from an array in the `SceneBridge Loader` prefab
 	- Five types of loading screens (more details in the [Loading Screens section](https://github.com/Persomatey/unity-scene-bridge/#loading-screens)):
		```
		└── LoadingScreen
  			├── AutomaticLoadingScreen
    		├── UIGatedLoadingScreen
    		├── InputManagerGatedLoadingScreen
    		└── InputSystemGatedLoadingScreen
		```
- The loading screen you want can be set in `SceneBridgeLoader.chosenLoadingScreen`
	- <img src="https://github.com/Persomatey/unity-scene-bridge/blob/main/images/PrefabInspectorScreenshot-ChosenLoadingScreenHighlighted.png?raw=true">
- Scene transition animation support
	- Transition animations can play into (and out of) screens
		- Ex: Play a transition animation into the loading screen, then a transition animation into the new scene.
  		- Ex: Play a transition animation when loading into a new scene directly 
	- Duration control for the animations
 		- `SceneBridgeLoader.AnimationDuration` 
		- Included animations are exactly one second to make it easy to calculate the speed of the animation given a duration
	- Mid-point duration control
 		- `SceneBridgeLoader.TransitionMidPointDuration` 
		- If you want there to be a slight pause in between the "transition in" and "transition out" animations (to hang on a black screen for a sec or something)
	- Transitions included in the `SceneBridge Loader` prefab by default: 
		- Fade
			- Fade to black / fade out of black
			- Included in the nested `Fade Transition Canvas` canvas
		- Swipe
			- Swipe to black / swipe out of black
			- Included in the nested `swipe Transition Canvas` canvas
	- It's easy to swap in/out which animations you want into the `SceneBridgeLoader.transitionCanvases` array
		- Pass which transition index you want to play by passing it as a variable to the functions outlined below 
	- Feel free to create your own transition animations!
 		- Remember to add them to the `SceneBridgeLoader.transitionCanvases` array 
		- <img src="https://github.com/Persomatey/unity-scene-bridge/blob/main/images/PrefabInspectorScreenshot-TransitionArrHighlighted.png?raw=true">
- Several scene loading functions:
	- Outlined in the [Loading Functions](https://github.com/Persomatey/unity-scene-bridge/#loading-functions) section
 	- Maybe sometimes you want the loading screen to appear, sometimes you don't 
- Ability to change loading screen shown
	- In case there are times when gating progression makes sense, and others where it doesn't
- Scene Cleanup
	– Automatically unload previous scenes after switching to the new one
- (Optional) DontDestroyOnLoad support for persistence across scenes
	- Not sure why you wouldn't want this enabled for a tool like this, but it's an option just in case 

### Loading Screens 
#### Base Classes (not meant to actually be used): 
- Loading Screen
	- `LoadingScreen.cs`
 	- Base class for all loading screens

## Future Plans 
*No plans on when I'd release these features, would likely depend on my needs for a specific project/boredom/random interest in moving this project along.*
- Minimum loading screen duration
	- Add a variable to all loading screens that has X seconds (tunable) alive to prevent loading screens from flashing too quickly on fast loads 
- Timer Conditional Loading Screen 
	- A type of derived loading screen (one for each type of screen) that stays on the mid-transition animation until X seconds (tunable) before it decides to show the loading screen.
		- Maybe inheritance isn't the best call here... maybe make this a toggleable option in all loading screen classes? Or use a design pattern like an Interface or something?
	- Another solution to the "loading screens from flashing too quickly on fast loads" problem but also one that some games might just feel better with
